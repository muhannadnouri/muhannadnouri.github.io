This is my review for Google's Pixel 2 XL phone after one full year of using it as my daily driver.

### Context

After a frustrating experience running out of storage on my previous Samsung Galaxy S7, even with a microSD, I decided to max out the storage option on the Pixel 2 XL. The biggest factor in picking the highest available storage option was due to many applications running significantly slower when moved to the microSD storage. I tried different microSD options with higher speeds, but alas, a lot of the applications I used on the daily (namely Spotify) performed much worse on the microSD storage as opposed to internal storage.

Prior to owning the Galaxy S7, I had the Google Nexus 5 and wanted a vanilla Android experience, something Samsung's phones lack. It was especially frustrating that Samsung phones came loaded with a lot of bloatware (unwanted applications you cannot uninstall) like the Facebook application and an entire suite of Samsung-branded applications I never used.

But enough about Samsung, let's dive into this review!

### Design
The Pixel 2 XL smartphone body has a very conventional design rectangle with rounded edges design. It is clear Google did not take any risk to create something unique or memorable in its phone design, but that is not to say it detracts from the smartphone's excellence. After all, Google's line of Nexus and Pixel phones have always been there to impress on the software side of things.

In addition, it is abundantly clear that smartphone manufacturers keep creating larger and larger smartphones. This comes at the cost of the smartphone having poorer one-handed usage but makes for a great experience when it comes to watching YouTube or Netflix on your smartphone. One handed usage was not one of the important criteria for me when it came to selecting a smartphone, and that's why I decided to go with the XL version of the Pixel smartphone.

### Software
Good software can make up for bad hardware! This has always been my personal philosophy when it came to finding the right device for myself. The best example of that in today's market is Apple's MacBook laptops (shots fired).

Nevertheless, this is not meant to convey that the Pixel 2 XL has weak hardware, instead it is equipped with a speedy Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset. This is coupled with the Google's vanilla Android 9.0 experience makes for one blazing fast smartphone.

### Camera
One of the main components that made the Pixel 2 a much more attractive choice than most other smartphones at the time was the camera.

The camera performs spectacularly in low light conditions. Images do not look grainy when lacking light, and more recently, Google's night shot update that brought their night mode feature from the Pixel 3 has made night shots look truly spectacular with a minimal loss of quality.

The attached series of images showcase the true prowess the Pixel's camera has to offer.

Let's talk about portrait mode. Portrait has been the talk of the town amongst smartphone cameras ever since Apple released a portrait mode in the iPhone 7 Plus back in 2016.

Google's approach to portrait mode was to include one camera unit on the phone and to take care the photo in the backend through some software magic (Magic Emoji). As a result, you are presented with a bokeh effect on each portrait mode photo, and you can seamlessly transition between both the portrait and non-portrait version since the phone saves both images.

I brought the Pixel as the only camera with me on two separate vacations, and it was nothing short of excellent. The camera was very reliable for all my photo needs on vacation whether it was the front-facing selfie camera, or taking photos at night.

### Battery
The rule of thumb when it comes to battery life is 10% discharge for every hour of usage on your phone. By that logic, you should be able to squeeze about 10 hours of usage out of your smartphone.

But of course, every rule has an exception, except this one.When it comes to battery life, the Pixel 2 XL is pretty solid at getting you through the day from a full 9AM to 5PM day.

### Summary
In conclusion, if were to rewind time, would I purchase the Pixel 2 XL again? The answer is without a doubt yes. The Pixel 2 XL has provided me with one of the best smartphone experiences to date. I would recommend it to anyone searching for a new smartphone. It still holds its own against other newer smartphones in 2019 but comes at a reduced price whether you're buying it directly from Google or your local phone carrier.
